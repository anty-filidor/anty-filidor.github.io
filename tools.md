Here are some original open-source tools and datasets for computational intelligence that I have recently developed or contributed to.

# Computational Packages

- **[network-diffusion](https://github.com/anty-filidor/network_diffusion)**  
  A package for the static and dynamic analysis of multilayer networks, including an environment for simulating spreading phenomena.

- **[mABCD](https://github.com/KrainskiL/MLNABCDGraphGenerator.jl)**  
  A generator of synthetic multilayer networks with a power-law structure, offering a high degree of customisation.

# Datasets

- **[ts-dataset](https://github.com/network-science-lab/top-spreaders-dataset)**  
  A collection of over 200 multilayer networks with labelled spreading potentials of their actors.

- **[l2-net](https://network-diffusion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/net_collection.html#network_diffusion.nets.l2_course_net.get_l2_course_net)**  
  A longitudinal multilayer network capturing peer interactions in an isolated social environment during an abroad language course.

# Machine Learning Models

- **[df-whisper](https://github.com/piotrkawa/deepfake-whisper-features)**  
  Detecting audio deepfakes using Whisper-based features.

- **[ts-net](https://github.com/network-science-lab/infmax-trainer-icm-mln)**  
  Identifying superspreaders in multilayer networks with an inductive graph neural network.
