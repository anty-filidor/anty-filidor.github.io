# Simple Landing Page

This is my personal page. To set it up I have used Jekyll and
[bay_jekyll_theme](https://github.com/eliottvincent/bay). Nonetheless, the template was customised
by me. All contents of `_layouts` and `assets` could be as well deleted and then the original
layout would be retrieved.
