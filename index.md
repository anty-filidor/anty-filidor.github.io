Cześć <span style="font-size:0.85em;">(Hello)</span>,
</p>

Welcome to my website. My name is Michał <span style="font-size:0.85em;">(Michael)</span> --- I am a doctoral candidate and a Research & Teaching Assistant at [Wrocław University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/) in Lower Silesia, Poland. This site highlights my research activities as well as teaching I have undertaken over the years.

My academic interests include __complex systems__, __graph mining__, and __machine learning__. On the industrial side, I am particularly drawn to the __commercialisation of R&D projects__, with a strong focus on software reliability and the transition of prototypes into fully-fledged industrial systems.

I am always happy to discuss these topics --- or, for a complete change of pace, the history of Central Europe, which happens to be one of my greatest passions, although this website does not cover that. 🙂
