  Hello, Internet Traveller!
</p>

Welcome to my personal site. My name is Michał (or Michael in English) — I'm a machine learning
engineer and a doctoral candidate at [WUST](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/). This website highlights my
research, engineering activities, and some of the teaching I've done over the years.

My academic interests include __graph mining__, __network analysis__, and __computer vision__. On
the business side, I'm particularly drawn to the __commercialisation of research and development
projects__, with a strong emphasis on software reliability and the transition of deep learning
models from research prototypes to fully-fledged industrial systems.

I'm always happy to talk about these topics — or, for a complete change of pace, the history of
Central Europe, which happens to be one of my greatest passions.
